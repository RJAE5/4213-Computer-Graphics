## A01 - WebGL Introduction in Parts
### Rykir Evans
### Description:

These programs introduce using WebGL Triangles for basic to complex scenes. The 1st part of this assignment was setting up the WebGL environment itself, thus there is no dedicated part. The remaining two parts are creation of scenes in increasing complexity, detailed below.

#### Part 1
This program depicts a simplified Sierpinski Triangle, utilizing manual positioning of the triangles and different colors. The top triangles utilize a gradient by making the verticies of each triangle a different color. The bottom triangles use the primary RGB and CYM color schemes.

#### Part 2
This scene depicts a brick facade with a road angled as to indicate perspective. It additionally makes use of a function to create the bricks and change the background color representing day and night. A button below the canvas allows you to activate this function.

#### Usage
1. Download the `index` file you wish to run and navigate to your downloads to run it
