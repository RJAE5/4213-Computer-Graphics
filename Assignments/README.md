### AI Disclaimer

At MSU Texas, use of AI is (currently) at the discretion of the professor, and I will adhere to the rules laid out for each class in their respective syllabus. First and foremost, the syllabus for this course [(CMPS 4213 - Introduction to Computer Graphics Fall 2025)](./course_syllabus.pdf) follows MSU's Computer Science Department's general policy, which does not generally deny the usage of AI so long as proper credit is given and there are instructions that allow it per assignment.

My usage of AI in this course is limited and follows the laid out rules for each assignment. "Usage" includes occasionally asking for explanations or quick reviewal processes. When allowed, only minimal (if any) sections of code in programs made for this course have been adapted from an AI-generated version, and these segments are clearly marked with comments, crediting those blocks to the respective LLM.

**My personal view on AI** (fully aware that I am a university student at the time of writing) is that it should be utilized as a tool to boost personal efficiency, typically in the form of discovering errors quickly, summarizing large walls of text, and other orgnizational tasks. Additionally, I see that AI tools are a great standardized learning resource for surface-level information. I believe the issue is when we use AI to accomplish things we do not know how to do ourselves. This leads to not "exercising" our brain and ultimately weakening it. I see that becoming dependent on AI to do mentally-taxing tasks is a slippery slope, and one I do not intend to fall down in my career. 

The purpose of this disclaimer is to enhance my personal standards on properly crediting the use of AI, as it is undeniably a part of my future career, whether it helps or hurts me.
