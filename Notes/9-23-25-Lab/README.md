### 9-23-2025 JavaScript Objects and Interaction

All of the coding today happened in [1_js_lab.js](./1_js_lab.js), the file was created from scratch. It creates a hero object and 10 zombies all with a position managed. We implemented a `moveLeft()` function to update the position of the hero, and I caught an error so **he said he would give me +2 points on my assignment.**

We didn't actually render anything, but it more so an introduction to JavaScript and managing objects, covering the key concepts:
* Variables
* Arithmetic
* Conditionals
* Events
